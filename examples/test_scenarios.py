THIS SCRIPT TESTS SCENARIOS FOR TWO-AGENT INTERACTION.
THE FIRST PART CONSISTS OF ONE OR MORE STATEMENTS, FOLLOWED BY ONE OR MORE QUESTIONS RELATED TO SAID STATEMENTS.
THIS SCRIPT IS SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, LANGUAGE GENERATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN
THIS PACKAGE SO THE BEHAVIOUR CANNOT BE COMPARED.
